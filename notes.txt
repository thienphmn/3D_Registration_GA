History:
=== Representation of Individuals ===
- real coded individuals where transformation parameters are encoded with floating point numbers [tx, ty, theta]
    - avoids problems with binary encoding like hamming cliff
    - allows for direct mutation and crossover of relevant transformation parameters
    - avoids having to reconvert binary representations to real values used for actual transformation
- understanding the problem necessary to simplify search space
    - scaling made redundant because DICOM has information on voxel spacing in metadata
    - shearing is made irrelevant because human anatomy normally doesnt change my shearing


=== Similarity Metric ===
- Mutual Information as the sum of the weighted ratio of joint probabilities over the individual probabilities of pixel
intensities
    - measures the statistical dependence between two images based on how often pixel intensities occur together
- better than other similarity metrics like Mean Squared Difference because no linear dependence is assumed


=== Construction of Algorithm ===
- (µ+λ) Genetic Algorithm Strategy where µ=100 and λ=2*µ
- binary encoding from previous interns scratched in favor of real valued individuals

- initialize first generation and evaluate before generational loop
- tournament selection with size=2 used for parent selection where parent_amount = µ
- produce λ offspring using blended crossover where offspring is uniformly sampled around their parents' parameter range
- mutate offspring with gaussian noise with mutation_strength = 20% global search space -> heavy exploration
    - decrease mutation strength linearly with each generation to facilitate exploitation in later generations
- evaluate offspring populations' fitness
- join generational population and offspring with their respective fitness_scores; discard parent generation
- take µ best individuals to pass to the next generation


=== Convergence Metrics ===
- Parameter Diversity, Mean Fitness, Best Fitness, Fitness Diversity
- if best fitness and mean fitness converge to be the same too quickly it means diversity is lost too fast
- if best fitness improves rapidly and fitness trails behind it is a good sign of a good algorithm that preserves
diversity while improving on the best solution

Current 3D Development Issues:
=== Downsampling ===
- Isotropic not the best options as you lose lots of slices.
    --> Solution: Do anisotropic downsampling to shrink x and y axes while preserving slice fidelity
- MRIs start out having significantly lower resolution than CT scans, so MRIs are shrunken by smaller factors
  than CT scans

=== Rotation Representation ===
- Euler angles, Rotation Vectors or Quaternions -> Rotation Vector chosen for its simplicity and continuity

=== Balancing Exploration with Exploitation ===
- at the start alpha=0.5 for blended crossover and mutation_strength = 20% of paramter range with linear decrease
    --> especially in the beginning, many individuals were pushed to very edge of parameter ranges
        this lead to moving image being pushed completely out of bounds so that its domain only consists of 0 values
        --> leads to falsified high MI score because joint histograms are concentrated on the bottom of the histogram
- now alpha = 0.2 and initial mutation strength = 0.15
- high initial µ with λ=3 to favor diversity and not lose promising solution regions
    - lower µ in later generations when diversity shrinks and GA optimizes a singular valley with global maximum

=== Physical Space Registration ===
- allows for easy dynamic resolution handling (coarse-to-fine registration, resolution mismatches between MRI/CT)
- resampling is my best friend <3 (very important to get render one image into the other's coordinate system)
- 6 Degrees of Freedom (more transformation parameters to optimize vs 2D registration)

History:
=== Representation of Individuals ===
- real coded individuals where transformation parameters are encoded with floating point numbers [tx, ty, theta]
    - avoids problems with binary encoding like hamming cliff
    - allows for direct mutation and crossover of relevant transformation parameters
    - avoids having to reconvert binary representations to real values used for actual transformation
- understanding the problem necessary to simplify search space
    - scaling made redundant because DICOM has information on voxel spacing in metadata
    - shearing is made irrelevant because human anatomy normally doesnt change my shearing


=== Similarity Metric ===
- Mutual Information as the sum of the weighted ratio of joint probabilities over the individual probabilities of pixel
intensities
    - measures the statistical dependence between two images based on how often pixel intensities occur together
- better than other similarity metrics like Mean Squared Difference because no linear dependence is assumed


=== Construction of Algorithm ===
- (µ+λ) Genetic Algorithm Strategy where µ=100 and λ=2*µ
- binary encoding from previous interns scratched in favor of real valued individuals

- initialize first generation and evaluate before generational loop
- tournament selection with size=2 used for parent selection where parent_amount = µ
- produce λ offspring using blended crossover where offspring is uniformly sampled around their parents' parameter range
- mutate offspring with gaussian noise with mutation_strength = 20% global search space -> heavy exploration
    - decrease mutation strength linearly with each generation to facilitate exploitation in later generations
- evaluate offspring populations' fitness
- join generational population and offspring with their respective fitness_scores; discard parent generation
- take µ best individuals to pass to the next generation


=== Convergence Metrics ===
- Parameter Diversity, Mean Fitness, Best Fitness, Fitness Diversity
- if best fitness and mean fitness converge to be the same too quickly it means diversity is lost too fast
- if best fitness improves rapidly and fitness trails behind it is a good sign of a good algorithm that preserves
diversity while improving on the best solution

Current 3D Development Issues:
=== Downsampling ===
- Isotropic not the best options as you lose lots of slices.
    --> Solution: Do anisotropic downsampling to shrink x and y axes while preserving slice fidelity
ITS INCOMPLETE AHHHHHH

=== Rotation Representation ===
Euler angles, Rotation Vectors or Quaternions
